## üåü Introduction

Welcome to this Obsidian PDF to Markdown Converter! This plugin brings the power of advanced PDF conversion directly into your Obsidian vault. By leveraging the capabilities of Marker through a self-hosted API or by using the hosted solution on [datalab.to](https://www.datalab.to/), this plugin offers a seamless way to transform your PDFs into rich, formatted Markdown files, with support for tables, formulas and more!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires a Marker API endpoint, a paid account for datalab or the python api of marker to work. Without an endpoint, the application can't convert anything.

You can find the related repositories here:

- [Marker Project](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) (AI model for PDF conversion + Simple Python API)
- [datalab.to](https://www.datalab.to/) (Hosted API for the Marker AI model, provided by the developer himself)
- [Marker API Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/wirawan/marker-api) (Container for self-hosting, needs Nvidia GPU)
- [Marker API](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/marker-api) (API for self-hosting the conversion service)

## üöÄ Features

- **OCR Capabilities**: Convert scanned PDFs to rich markdown
- **Formula Detection**: Accurately captures and converts mathematical formulas
- **Table Extraction**: Preserves table structures in your Markdown output
- **Image Handling**: Extracts and saves images from your PDFs and includes them in the markdown
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple PDFs at once by selecting files with Alt + Click (Note: Processing multiple files may take considerable time depending on their size and complexity)
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Works on both desktop and mobile Obsidian apps
- **Flexible Output**: Choose between full content extraction or specific elements (text/images)

## üõ† Why This Plugin?

1. **Superior Extraction**: Utilizes the Marker project's advanced AI model for high-quality conversions
2. **Mobile Accessibility**: Unlike many converters, this works seamlessly on mobile devices (when the API is accessible)
3. **Customizable**: Tailor the conversion process to your specific needs
4. **Obsidian Integration**: Converts PDFs directly within your Obsidian environment

## üìã Requirements

To use this plugin, you'll need:

1. A working Obsidian installation
2. Access to a Marker API endpoint (self-hosted or paid service or python api)

## üîß Setup

1. Install the plugin in your Obsidian vault
2. (Optional) Set up the self-hosted Marker API:

   - Use Docker on a machine with a solid GPU/CPU
   - (Optional) Make the endpoint available to other devices (e.g., using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/))
   - Alternatively, host in the cloud or run the Python server when needed
3. Configure your Marker API endpoint in the plugin settings

### üßæ Usage

You can convert PDFs to Markdown in multiple ways:

1. **Single PDF file**: Right-click on a PDF file in the file explorer and select "Convert to MD" from the context menu
2. **Multiple PDF files**: Select multiple PDF files with Alt + Click and right-click to convert them all at once
3. **PDF file in editor**: After opening a PDF file in the editor, click on the three dots in the top right corner and select "Convert to MD"
4. **Use the command palette**: Open the command palette and search for "Convert PDF to MD" (only works if a PDF file is open)

## üôè Acknowledgements

This plugin wouldn't be possible without the incredible work of:

- [Marker Project](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker): The AI model powering the conversions
- [Marker API](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/marker-api): The API that enables self-hosting of the conversion service

A huge thank you to these projects for their contributions to the community!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues related to the plugin itself, please open an issue in this repository. For problems with the conversion process or API, please refer to the Marker and Marker API repositories.

> [!NOTE]
> When converting multiple files at once, be patient as the process can take a significant amount of time depending on the size and complexity of your PDFs. For very large batches, consider processing them in smaller groups.
